# Slack request

*(If you are not on Slack... Let us know, and we will remedy that.)*

I will get your names eventually, but if you want to help me out...

**Put up your first name and a pic up on Slack**

(Also, can you put your github URL in the "What I Do" field)

---

# `subl`

## What is an "environment variable"?

```
console.log(process.env);
```

## What is the "PATH" environment variable?
```
console.log(process.env.PATH);
```

## Why is this good for us?

* Your CLI will become your primary means of navigating the file system
* `subl` allows us to quickly open files and projects as we navigate from the CLI

---

# Github ssh keys

## What is "public-key" encryption?

* Encrypt with private, decrypt with public
* Encrypt with public, decrypt with private

> Makes security on the internet possible

## What is ssh?

* Stands for "secure shell"
* A "cryptographic network protocol"

## What is a shell?

* `bash` or `zshell`
* Interacts with the computer using text-based input and output

## Why is this good for us?

* Don't have to enter your password every time

# Toolbox review

* **Language:** JavaScript
* **CLI (Terminal + Shell):** iTerm + zshell (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)
* **Editor (with Linter):** Sublime Text 3
* **Source Version Control:** Git
* **Source Repository:** Github
* **Runtime:** Node (and later a browser)

---

# One more: oh-my-zsh

We are going to be spending a lot of time in the shell...

(Plugin system for `zshell`)

But, next time...

---

# Git + github review

Push functions file from last time.

---

# `function` review

* Verbs: *call*, *invoke*, *apply*

* Invoked with values, returns a value
* Parameters are just variables
*
